# Implemented if I have more time

With more time, I would enhance the PaymentButton component by adding comprehensive form validation, a loading indicator, and improved error handling for various scenarios. Integration with a real payment gateway and styling enhancements would be prioritized. Auto-focus on input fields and accessibility improvements would further refine user experience. Localization support and a user feedback mechanism would be implemented for broader reach and insight.
I created Login page and add functionality for user signup and signin 

# Assumptions

 Assumptions included standardized API responses, basic validation sufficiency, predefined field options, intuitive and browser compatibility. These steps aim to bolster the componentâ€™s robustness, usability, and overall effectiveness.
